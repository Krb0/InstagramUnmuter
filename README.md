It's an Chrome extension created because I got sick of having to unmute every story/post while I was using Instagram. 

It started being just a simple script that unmutes stories, but because of it having a good feedback when I posted it on <a href="https://greasyfork.org/es/scripts/417788-instagram-story-unmute-instagram-stories-unmuter-muted-instagram-story">Greasy Fork</a> I decided to code the extension. 

Now it just became a chrome extension where I practice and add new ideas.
